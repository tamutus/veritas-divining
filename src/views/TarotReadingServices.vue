      <h2>ADD-ONS</h2>

      <p>
        For a nominal fee, any reading service listed above can be augmented
        with an add-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please discuss any desired add-ons to your reading request prior to
        commencement of the reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add-ons are at your option only and are not necessary for a complete
        reading. Any service offered above is a complete and comprehensive
        service by itself. Yet these additional services can add invaluable
        insights that can enhance the original reading service.

          A final card can be drawn after your reading to show you how to change
          your future. If the probable outcome indicated in your reading is not
          favorable to you, have an adjustment card drawn to see how you can
          alter your life path and what corresponding Affirmations your
          Adjustment Card has to offer you.

        ADD ON: Supplemental Oracle Card Reading
      </Pricing>
      <h3>(Price varies according to number of Cards drawn)</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes a tarot reading will highlight an obstacle, tension, conflict,
        or area that needs improvement and after the reading, you may want
        additional clarification on that specific point as a follow-up to the
        main reading you received. A supplemental oracle card reading can offer
        the affirmations, insights, and additional information you need to
        clarify that point

      <h2>Tarot Reading Events</h2>

      <p>
        I am available for in-person reading at events or parties, but only
        after the end of all Pandemics! If there are children present at the
        event AND the parents of the children attending the party consent to a
        tarot reader, only then will I read for minors.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can arrange in advance whether you would like me to give 5 minute
        readings, 10 minute readings, or 15 minute readings per person.
      </p>
