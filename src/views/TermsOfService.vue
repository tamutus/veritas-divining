    <section>
      <h2>Terms of Service</h2>

      <h3>Payment Terms.</h3>

      <p>
        For all readings under $100.00, the full fee is due at the time your
        request is made, prior to the reading. Payment must be received by Cres
        Veritas before the commencement of your reading. For readings over
        $100.00, a 20% deposit is due at the time the reading is scheduled to
        reserve your appointment. Due to the time and labor required for the
        longer readings, you must reserve the appointment well in advance with a
        deposit. Within 24 hours prior to the scheduled appointment or right
        before your reading begins, full payment must be tendered to Cres
        Veritas. Due to the difficulty with debt collection, all payments for
        reading requests must be tendered in advance.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment Methods</h3>

      <p>
        For online readings, Cres Veritas accepts PayPal or Zelle. All payment
        transfers are done through the third party platforms
        <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> and
        <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/">Zelle</a>, so please be familiar
        with the privacy policy and terms of use for these third party
        platforms. Cres Veritas is not liable for any mishandling by these third
        party platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        For in-person readings, cash is preferred- you may still pay using the
        aforementioned options listed above. Cres Veritas does not accept checks
        or money orders. If your credit card is declined or payment is not
        properly transferred due to deficiencies on your end, then Cres Veritas
        will be entitled to the balance owed plus a 25% interest as additional
        charge for the deficiency.
      </p>

      <h3>Refund Policy</h3>

      <p>
        Tarot readings by Cres Veritas constitute a professional service and due
        to the nature of the service and labor involved, all readings are
        non-refundable. However, if no reading was performed or your tarot
        professional has cancelled the reading prior to its commencement, then
        of course, your fee will be refunded to you in full. Cres Veritas
        exercises great reasonable care and diligence in performing each and
        every tarot reading. If you are dissatisfied with your reading, please
        contact your tarot professional to see if an agreeable settlement may be
        worked out.
      </p>

      <h3>Statement of Tarot Ethics.</h3>

      <p>
        A Code of Conduct is provided on our
        <router-link to="/ethics">Ethics page</router-link>, which covers the
        ethical policy of Cres Veritas, hereby integrated and incorporated into
        this Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope of Life Coach Services.</h3>

      <p>
        The tarot reading services provided by Cres Veritas are more akin to
        life coach services and they strive to help you work on your goals for
        the future and create the life path you desire. Your tarot reading with
        Cres Veritas in no way replaces professional counseling from a licensed
        counselor or therapist and cannot be relied upon in lieu of sound legal,
        medical, or financial advice from licensed or qualified professionals.
        Cres Veritas in no way diagnoses problems, but rather, suggests creative
        perspectives for understanding your current problems or help you come up
        with actions you can take to empower yourself in a way that will
        maximize your personal and professional potentials. Cres Veritas strives
        to help you improve the quality of your life by tapping into your
        intuition. The role of a life coach is to provide support and advice for
        living well.
      </p>

      <h3>Disclosure of Limitations.</h3>

      <p>
        A tarot reading should never be used in place of professional
        counseling. Your reading cannot offer legal, medical, business, or
        financial advice nor does any portion of your reading from Cres Veritas
        purport to do so. You should not rely on a tarot reading to make any
        decision that would affect your legal, financial, or medical condition.
        If your inquiry involves the law, finance, or medicine, then you should
        seek the advice of a licensed or qualified legal, financial, or medical
        professional. Also, a tarot reading cannot replace qualified mental
        health care. A tarot reading can only facilitate how you cope
        spiritually with a given situation.
      </p>

      <h3>Video Reading Recordings.</h3>

      <p>
        Cres Veritas may, at your option, provide video conference tarot
        readings through third party platforms or hosts, such as Telegram,
        Discord, or Google Duo. Before consenting to a video reading, please go
        over any questions or concerns you may have with Cres Veritas. By
        commencing a video reading, you are consenting to the terms herein.
        Likewise, please be advised that you are not permitted to record video
        readings without express, written permission from Cres Veritas. If you
        would like to record your video tarot reading, please ask before doing
        so.
      </p>

      <h3>Confidentiality of Tarot Readings.</h3>

      <p>
        Cres Veritas exercises reasonable diligence in maintaining the
        confidentiality of your tarot reading and will not voluntarily,
        knowingly, intentionally, or willfully disclose your identity or the
        contents of your tarot reading to third parties. However, if Cres
        Veritas genuinely believes disclosure is required to: (1) prevent
        imminent harm or risk of harm to yourself or to another, (2) meet any
        applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or
        (3) protect or defend Cres Veritas against claims or threats of claims,
        then Cres Veritas reserves the right to do so to the extent reasonably
        necessary. Please keep in mind that no legally recognized privilege
        exists between a tarot professional and client the way a privilege might
        exist between an attorney and client, doctor and patient, married
        individuals, or priest and penitent.
      </p>

      <h3>Fortune Telling Laws.</h3>

      <p>
        Pursuant to applicable laws of certain jurisdictions, a person can be
        guilty of fortune telling when, for a fee or compensation, that person
        claims or pretends to tell fortunes, or holds him or herself out as
        being able, by claimed or pretended use of occult powers, to answer
        questions or give advice on personal matters or to exorcise, influence,
        or affect evil spirits or curses, unless otherwise done so explicitly
        for entertainment purposes only. Any and all readings provided by Cres
        Veritas neither claims nor pretends to tell fortunes and neither claims
        nor pretends to use occult powers in ways that would run against such
        laws. In certain jurisdictions, a tarot professional is required to
        disclose to you that tarot readings should be for entertainment purposes
        only, and if such a law applies to your reading, then you are hereby on
        notice thereof.
      </p>
