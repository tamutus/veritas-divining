        Cres did my Tarot reading in January of last year, and it honestly
        changed how that year went for me. Through the cards, Cres revealed
        things in my life I had been unwilling to confront, and gave me a new
        perspective that allowed me to make real changes. Most importantly, Cres
        was caring and compassionate throughout my reading. I would highly
        recommend getting a reading from them.

        The reading I received from Cres was absolutely amazing and super easy
        to understand. It was phenomenal how many questions I had were answered
        and lead to many doors of opportunities and insightful precautions I
        needed to take. They are amazing and I recommend anyone to receive a
        reading from them.
