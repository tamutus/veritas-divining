          “Yes/no”, “should”, and time questions are best avoided—instead, ask:
          “can”, “what”, and “how”.
        </p>

        <h3>Keep your options open.</h3>

        <h3>Limit the scope of your Question.</h3>
        <p>Try not to be too broad nor too specific</p>

        <h3>Keep the focus on yourself and what you can do</h3>

        <h3>Keep the Question neutral and be open to guidance</h3>

        <h3>Be Positive</h3>
